# AdventureMode
## Version 1.0.19

Clearly this program generates a random set of waypoints on which to base each game instance of your session. Basically were you to want something basically random and you enjoy farming pretty much any area of the game, or want to try new regions without randomly selecting your own areas, use this program.

It's pretty simple. I cannot make a release at this time. Go to **commit 9** for reference as *that is the last commit that compiled without any editing of the source*.

Other than this, enjoy messing around in D2R.
